# HTML & CSS

## Introduction

The book is divided into three sections:
1. **HTML** :  The first chapter looking at how HTML is used to create web pages.
2. **CSS** : explains how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages.
3. **Practical** : some helpful information that will assist you in building better websites.

### How People Access the Web
* Browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.)
* Webservers ( When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer)
* Devices ( People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.)
* Screen readers ( programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments. )


### How Websites Are Created?
* All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

### How the Web Works ?
* When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Extra Markup

### Development of HTML
Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).
* HTML Versions:
* HTML 4 - 1997
* XHTML 1.0 - 2000
* HTML 5 - 2000

### DOCTYPES
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

### Comments in HTML
”< !– –>” – add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user’s browser.

### Class Attribute
* To Identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
Block Elements
* Elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.
Inline Elements
* Elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.

### Grouping Text & Elements In a Block
Allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

### Grouping Text & Elements Inline
acts like an inline equivalent of the < div> element.

### IFrames
* little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page.
    * src
    * height
    * width
    * Scrolling
    * Frameborder
    * Seamless

### < meta >
The < meta> element lives inside the < head> element and contains information about that web page.

### Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

## Definition of HTML5

### Elements of HTML5:
* Headers < header >
* Footers < footer >
* Navigation < nav >
* Articles < article >
* Aside < aside >
* Sections < section >
* Heading Groups < hgroup >
* Figures < figure > < figcaption >
* Sectioning Elements < div >
* Linking Around Block-Level Elements

# Process and Design

### How to ensure the pages feature the information those visitors need.

* Understanding the Audience.
* Information Organizaion.
* Presenting Information.
* Tips for Attractive and Professional Sites.

## Users of the WebSites ?
* The WebSites should be for all People and not only for some users.

## And why they visit it?
* The Websites content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users.

## What Information Your Visitors Need?
* You may want to offer additional supporting information that you think they might find helpful.

## How Often People Will Visit Your Site?
* Everytime you make updates , you will get a new visiyor.

## Site Map
* It's the way how you design the website.
* Information which will appear in the website.
* Usually begin with the homepage.
* The pages (or groups of pages) will inform how users navigate through the site.

## WireFrames
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site.

* make design easier because you know what information needs to appear on which page before considering how  he the page should look.

## Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand
* Content
* Prioritizing
* Organizing
* Visual hierarchy
* Grouping
* Similarity

### Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

### You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

# Javascript

## Introduction
* explains how JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly.


## How the JavaScript make the webpages interactive?

* We used JavaScribt to make the webpage interactive by accessing and modifying the webpage.

### Access Content:
* You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.

### Modify Content
* You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.

### PROGRAM RULES
* You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.

### REACT TO EVENTS
* You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

## The ABC of Programming:

1. Definition of Script:
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

* Script made up of instructions; a computer can follow step by step.
* The Webpage may be used different parts of the Script depening on how the user interacts with the webpage.

### Writing Script
* You need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

* The Script is a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem.

## Steps of Writing Scripts:
1. Define The Goal.
* define the task you want to achieve.

2. Design The Script.
* Writing down the steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task.

3. Code The Steps.
* Write every indiviual task by programming language that the computer understands.

## EXPRESSIONS.
* Types of Expressions:
1. EXPRESSIONS that just assign a value to a variable.

2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

### Operators: allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

## FUNCTIONS
* ***Functions*** used to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

* **Functions** offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve the task.

* **Calling the Function**: It's asking the fuction to perform its tadk, and the name shoul describe the task which it's performing.

### [Calling_Function](Calling function.gif)

* **Parameters**: Pieces of information passed to a function.

### [Parameters](Parameters.jpg)

* **Return value**: The expected answer that function will provide you.

## COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA.

* Each physica l thing in the world can be represented as an object. 
* There are two different types of objects here: a hotel and a car.
* Programmers might say that there is one instance of the hotel object, and two instances of the car object. Each object can have its own:
* Properties,
* Events,
* Methods,
Together they create a working model of that object.
