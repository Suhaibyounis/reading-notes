* *What I Learned from this interesting article is that a good team is the foundation for any high-performing business. Superficially, a thriving team looks very much like any other.

The attitudes, the behaviours, the interactions, the language and the environment all add up to create a thriving team.*

* *Itâ€™s important to remember that individuals on a team come from different backgrounds and can have different effects within a team setting.*
