### In conclusion :

* You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.
* Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
* You can use a *background image* behind the box created by any element on a page.
* *Background images* can appear just once or be *repeated across the background of the box*.
* You can create image rollover effects by moving the *background position of an image*.
* To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create *image sprites*.

### HTML Audio - How It Works

* The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

* The < source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

* The text between the < audio> and </ audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the < audio> element.

### **Video**

#### How it Works?

* The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

* It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

* The < source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

* The text between the < video> and </ video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the < video> element.


### Practical Information

* To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
* **FTP programs** allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
* Many companies provide *platforms* for *blogging*, *email newsletters*, *e-commerce* and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
