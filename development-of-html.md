## Development of HTML

* Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).

### HTML Versions:
* HTML 4 - 1997
* XHTML 1.0 - 2000
* HTML 5 - 2000

### DOCTYPES
Because there have been several versions of **HTML**, each web page should begin with a **DOCTYPE** declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

### Comments in HTML
* "< !-- -->" --  add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser.

### ID Attribute
* Every HTML element can carry the **ID attribute**. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

### Class Attribute
* To Identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

### Block Elements
* Elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.

### Inline Elements
* Elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.

### Grouping Text & Elements In a Block
* Allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

### Grouping Text & Elements Inline
* acts like an inline equivalent of the < div> element.

### IFrames
* little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page.

    * src
    * height
    * width
    * Scrolling
    * Frameborder
    * Seamless
    
## < meta >
* The < meta> element lives inside the < head> element and contains information about that web page.

## Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
