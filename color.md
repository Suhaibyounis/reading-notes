## Color

### Foreground Color
* The color property allows you to specify the color  of text inside an element.

### Ways of coloring in CSS:
1. **RGB Values**: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.

2. **Hex Codes**: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.

3. **Color Names**: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.

* CSS3 has also introduced another way to specify colors called **HSLA** .

### Background Color

* You can specify your choice of background color in three ways: RGB Values, Hex Codes, and Color Names

* We used the **Padding Property** to separate the text from the edges of the boxes.

## Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of Red, Green, and Blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

* Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called **Pixels** .

* When the screen is not turned on, it's **Black** because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.
* The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of **Red**,**Green**, and **Blue**.

## Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can
see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.

* The Hex value is provided next to the pound or hash **#** Symbol.

## Contrast

* When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be **Legible**.

* Low Contrast: Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.

* Medium Contrast: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.

* High Contrast: Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.

## Opacity & RGBA

**Opacity** 
* Allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
* The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

**RGBA**
* allows you to specify a color, with adds a fourth value to indicate opacity.
* This value is known as an **Alpha value** and is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

## HSL Colors
* HUE: The colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.

* Saturation: The amount of gray in a color.
Saturation is represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.

* Lightness: The amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. 
Lightness is represented as a percentage. 
0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. 
Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.

## HSL & HSLA

* **HSL** : a way to specify colors. The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for:
1. HUE
2. Saturation
3. Lightness

* **HSLA** : Allows you to specify color properties using Hue, Saturation, and Lightness as above, and adds a fourth value which represents **Transparency**.

* This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency.
