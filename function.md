## FUNCTIONS
* ***Functions*** used to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

* **Functions** offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve the task.

* **Calling the Function**

* **Parameters**: Pieces of information passed to a function.

### [Parameters](Parameters.jpg)

* **Return value**: The expected answer that function will provide you.

### [return](return.png)

* **updatemessage** ; we can update the content of the page by document.getElementbyid

## Declaring a Function
Its giving the function name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curky braces.

* Declaring a function using the **function** keyword.
* Giving the function a **name** followed by parentheses.
* The **statement** that perform the task sit in a code block

***

**Calling the Function**: It's asking the fuction to perform its tadk, and the name shoul describe the task which it's performing.

### [Calling_Function](Calling function.gif)

* to run the code in the function, you ude the function name followed by **parentheses**.

* You can call the same function as many times as you want within the same JavaScript file.

## Declaring a Function that need Information

* Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task.

* Sometimes you declare the function you give it parameters.

* Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

## Calling function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name, these values called **Arguments**

* Arguments as **Values**
getArea(3, 5);

* Arguments as **Variables**
wallwidth = 3;
wallhright = 5;
getArea(wallwidtg, wallheight);

### **Parameters** vs **Arguments**
* Parameters; when the function is declared, you will see the words **width**and **height** used. inside the curly braces of the fubction, those words act like **Variables**.

* Arguments; in above you can see that the **getArea()** function in being called and the code specifies real numbers that will be used to perform the calculation, these values which passed into the code are called **Arguments**.

## Getting a Single Value out of a Function
* some functions return information to the code that called them.
